# Gabi Silvano
<sub> *Business Intelligence Consultant* </sub>

I am a designer with experience in electronic engineering. I worked for over 8 years with electronic product development before becoming passionate about the data world, after a difficult decision to get out of my job as a developer, I went to work as an auto-entrepreneur with Digital Marketing and was here that I discover the power of data.
In a few years, a new challenge presented, the invitation to move from Brazil to France, which was the opportunity for me to deepen my studies in data visualization and data analysis, and I realize that my knowledge in several fields helps me to understand and solve problems better. 
Today I work more with financial analysis, using Power BI, Python, SQL, and SSIS, and continue daily to study to develop my personal and professional skills.

**Background in:** Python, Power BI, SQL, Ruby
